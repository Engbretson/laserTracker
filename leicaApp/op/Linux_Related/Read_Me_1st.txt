Phoebus on wondows acts different than phoebus on Linux, especially is regards to starting the display manager and finding files.

Various screens also are rendered with x and y dimensions smaller that what the widgets require to fit in phoebus, so screens 
automagically generated from adl files really only work for medm and caqtdm.

So while there is a bob directory here . . . it might work on windows, but may not on linux . . .  so a separate Linux directory
exists here that lifts the startup file and screens as used on the s8idserv.
